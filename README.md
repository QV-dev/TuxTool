# TuxTool 0.0.2
Free and opensource screenshare tool for linux
To use, do the following:
Open terminal, and then do 
```
mkdir sstool
cd sstool
git clone https://github.com/QV-dev/TuxTool
cd TuxTool
cd TuxTool
sudo bash tuxtool.sh
```
I think I might start working on this again, false flags are prone to happen!
